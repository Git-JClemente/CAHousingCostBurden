# # California Housing Cost Burden Analysis Notebook
# 
# ## Introduction
# 
# This purpose of this project is to analyze the California housing cost burden between the years 2006 and 2010 in order to explore any potential patterns, trends and correlations within this time span. Additionally, from this analysis we can identify and quantify to an extent which counties/cities/demographics in California suffer the most these cost burdens. 
# 
# ### Motivation / Context
# 
# My personal motivation for performing this analysis was to learn more about how affordable (or unaffordable) the housing market was in California around 10-15 years ago, the severity of the cost burdens placed on families California as well as what characterized the types of communities that were most disadvantaged by this. Today, it is commonly known that the housing costs in California (especially in the Bay Area where I live) are extremely high yet competitive among buyers. As someone who has yet to own his first home, understanding what the housing cost burden has been historically compared to how it is now, can help to forecast the direction of the housing market as well as help me to set reasonable expectation in the future, should I choose to become a California home owner.
# 
# The dataset used for this analysis captures a variety of information pertaining to housing and California residents. This includes economic data such as income level of household and the percentage of households paying more than 30% (or 50%) of their monthly household income towards housing costs. In additional, geographical housing data such as geographic type, region name and region code, as well as, other demographic data including racial/ethnic group, are all shown on our dataset.  
# 
# ### Limitations
# As stated from the source material:
# 
# "The housing cost burden estimates do not adjust for differences in household size. Estimates for the survey period 2006-2010 are bisected by the Great Recession (2008), marked by a large increase in home foreclosures, and house/rental price instability. Due to changes in definitions and sampling, HUD does not recommend making comparisons to prior years' estimates. ACS data are available at census tract geographies, albeit with a definition of cost burden that is different than that of CHAS."
# 
# ## Data Preparation & Cleaning
# 
# The housing cost dataset used for this analysis was downloaded from the California Data Portal linked below:
# 
# https://data.ca.gov/dataset/housing-cost-burden
# 
# The dataset is downloaded as a .xlsx file by default. We convert this to a standard .csv file on Excel. Upon inspection of our .csv file on MS Excel, we see that there are 521265 total observations (rows) and 26 attributes (columns).
# 
# We will analyze this data using the Pandas Dataframe.

# From simply calling our data, we verify that the import into Python was successful as it appears as a table of 521265 rows Ã— 26 columns

# Not all the columns that we've imported into Python will probably be useful for our analysis. Therefore, we should further understand what each of the columns represent in close detail and then remove the columns we don't need.
# 
# Looking at the "Data Dictionary" file that we also downloaded from the California Data Portal URL, each column column, definition and format is shown on the table below. (For coding information, see original .csv or xlsx file since its too much to display here)

# Based on review of the Data Dictionary summary table, the data columns that don't appear to be very useful for the scope of this analysis and can be deleted. These particular columns and rationale for deletion is shown in the table below:
#

# | ind_id | Not needed since all values are the same (106)|
# | datasource | Not used in this analysis as datasource can easily be retrieved from raw file|
# | reportyear | Not needed since all values are the same (2006 - 2010) |
# | region_code |  No added information that "region_name" column does not already provide |
# | race_eth_code |  No added information that "race_eth_name" column does not already provide |
# | geoname | Information not necessary for this analysis |
# | LL95CI | Not needed since "rse" will be used to assess data reliability |

# We shall remove the unneeded columns we've identified below with the following lines of code
data_mod1 = data.drop(['ind_id', 'datasource','reportyear', 'region_code', 'race_eth_code','geoname', 'LL95CI', 'UL95CI', 'SE', 'CA_decile', 'CA_RR', 'version'], axis=1);

data_mod1.head()

# Now, we'll perform a count for all the values in the remaining columns.
data_mod1.count()


# In[6]:


# Then, perform a null count.
data_mod1.isnull().sum()

# Something important to note is that a value of "0" is typically treated as null. Therefore we have to verify that a null/zero
# were appropriate given the corresponding column values in the appropriate context


# In[7]:


# Right off the bat, we recognize a data cleaning opportunity based on our outputs above. 
# There are 3 rows that are null across all of our columns that we can remove from dataframe.
# We'll perform this deletion based off of our "ind_definition" column
data_mod2 = data_mod1.dropna(subset = ["ind_definition"], inplace=False);

# Verify deletion
data_mod2.isnull().sum()


# In[8]:


# We've successfully removed the null rows pertaining to those first 7 columns.
# Now let's validate that the 810 null values for our "county" columns is valid.
# The columns "county_name" and "county_fips" should be null when the "geotype" value is "CA" or "RE".
# In other words, there isn't a county name for observations that are state-wide or region-wide.

# Count the number of rows where "geotype" is CA or RE and "county_name" is null.
len(data_mod2[((data_mod2['geotype'] == 'CA') | (data_mod2['geotype'] == 'RE')) & (data_mod2['county_name'].isna())])

# If the result is 810 (as expected), then all of the nulls for "county_name" are valid.
                                                                                                     


# In[9]:


# We repeat the same process for "county_fips".
# Count the number of rows where "geotype" is CA or RE and "county_fips" is null.
len(data_mod2[((data_mod2['geotype'] == 'CA') | (data_mod2['geotype'] == 'RE')) & (data_mod2['county_fips'].isna())])

# If the result is 810 (as expected), then all of the nulls for "county_fips" are valid.


# In[10]:


# Now we'll address the 54 null values for "region_name".
# Of all the "geotype" values, only CA should not have an assigned region value.
# This is because a state-wide observation cannot be classifed or assigned to particular region, 
# whereas CO, CT, PL, RE all fall within a region.

# Count the number of rows where "geotype" is CA and "county_name" is null.
len(data_mod2[(data_mod2['geotype'] == 'CA') & (data_mod2['region_name'].isna())])

# If the result is 54 (as expected), then all of the nulls for "region_name" are valid.


# In[11]:


# We now shift our attention to the 308082 null values that were identifed for the columns "total_households" and
# "burdened_households". We can assume but will verify that these observations simply represent places where no one
# of that particular demographic, burden level or etc. is represented in that location

# Count the number of cases where "total_households" is null but "burdened_households" is not null.
Hou_NotZero = data_mod2['total_households'].isna() & data_mod2['burdened_households'].notna()
Hou_NotZero.value_counts()


# Count the number of rows where both "total_households" and "burdened_households" are null.
len(data_mod2[(data_mod2['total_households'].isna()) & (data_mod2['burdened_households'].isna())])

# If the result is 308082 (as expected), then we've successfully verified that no burdened households were mistakenly 
# counted in observations that had zero corresponding households as that would be an impossible situation and 
# clearly an error. However, the opposite situation where we have no burdened households despite a non-zero total 
# number of households is a possible scenario.


# In[12]:


# For the "percent" column, there are 341268 null values. Practically speaking, the only situation where percent is null
# null would be if and only if the corresponding "burdened_households" value was also null. In other words, the number
# of "burdened households" being null/zero should be the sole instance that translates to a null "percent"
# We perform our check again to ensure the inverse of this is always False.

# Count the number of rows where both "percent" and "burdened_households" are null.
len(data_mod2[(data_mod2['percent'].isna()) & (data_mod2['burdened_households'].isna())])

# The output only shows a total count of 308082, which shows there is another for "burdened_households", that yields 
# a null "percent"


# In[13]:


# As mentioned earlier, the value 0 can sometimes not be counted as a null. Therefore, we'll include a check that
# validates the instance where "burdened_households" is 0 as well.

# Count the number of rows where "percent" is null and "burdened_households" is 0.
len(data_mod2[(data_mod2['percent'].isna()) & (data_mod2['burdened_households'] == 0)])

# If the sum of this output and the previous output (308082) equals 341268,  then all of the nulls for "percent" 
# are valid.


# In[14]:


# Now that we know there is no invalid cases where percent is incorrectly null (or zero), we continue the data cleaning
# process by looking at "rse", which represents the Relative Standard Error. This value is an indicator of how reliabile
# the data is based off of the sample size taken. A null (or zero) value in this context is actually a good sign.
# However, based on the Data Dictionary file, an "rse" of 23 percent or more means that there was not a sufficient
# sample size taken and the data is considered unreliable.
# For this final step of the data cleaning process, we remove all rows where "rse" >= 23.

data_mod3 = data_mod2.drop(data_mod2[data_mod2.rse >= 23].index, inplace = False)

# Verify that there are no rows where "rse" >= 23
data_mod3[data_mod3.rse >= 23].shape[0]

# Once we've verified our rows have acceptable "rse" values, we can drop the column from our df since its no longer needed
data_mod4 = data_mod3.drop(['rse'], axis = 1)

# This concludes our data cleaning process check for any erroneous and unwanted null values in our dataframe.


# In[15]:


# Next, let's verify the data types of our dataframe.
data_mod4.dtypes

# Comparing the output of our data types to what was defined in the data dictionary, makes sense in the context of this analysis.
# No datatype conversions are needed at this time.


# In[16]:


# We notice that "geotypevalue" is a float64. Per the data dictionary and depending on the indicator context,
# this column represents either an 11 digit FIPS census tract code, a 5 digit FIPS code (place or county) or 2
# digit FIPS code (region or state). As we noticed from the original output preview using the "heads" function,
# All the values in the preview came out as "6.0" due to it being a floating value. For the context described,
# it is appropriate that we convert this value into an integer as follows.

data_mod4['geotypevalue'] = data_mod4['geotypevalue'].astype('int')


# In[17]:


# Now,we'll re-verify the change to the geotypevalue data type.
data_mod4.dtypes


# In[18]:


# And lastly, confirm all the values are properly listed using the "head" function to preview
print(data_mod4.geotypevalue)


# ## Analysis
# 
# Now that the data preparation and cleaning process  is complete,we can proceed with creating subsets of interest for our dataframe and performing our exploratory analysis. Since our table captures the cost burden indicators based on various attributes of the study (ethnicity, tenure, income leve, etc) creating ad-hoc subsets will assist us in organizing and eventually visualizing our data.

# 1. In all of California (by county), what percentage of households are affected by the following cost burdens, broken down by region in descending order? What is the mean and median for each?

# ### Data Visualization
# 
# The dataframes above were generated to capture the specific data needed to further investigate and answer the initial questions we had before performing our deep dive into our data. The data collected further guides our exploratory analysis and helps to potentially uncover new relationships within the data or understand the significance of our results. In this section, we will create data visualizations to capture and illustrate the major insights uncovered from our exploratory analysis.

# #### Housing Cost Burdens by Geographic Location (State-wide and Bay Area Region-Wide)
# 
# Question 1 aimed to explore the housing cost burden percentages across all California counties. The two severity levels of cost burden that were evaluated were at the  " > 30%" cost burden and " > 50%" cost burden, whether that be from rent or selected housing costs/mortgage. Also, for further inclusivity, this analysis considered all race/ethnic groups and  accounted for all  HUD-adjusted family median income. Looking at our results, the maximum percentage of households experiencing at least a 30% cost burden in each region was approximately 49.8% (San Benito County) while the minimum percentage of households was approximately 28.6% (North Coast). With the mean and median being very close (41.8% and 42.5%, respectively), the distribution of the percentage of households with a 30% cost burden appears to skew closer to the upper end. In part b of this question, we look at another metric at similar conditions except taken at least a 50% cost burden. To no surprise the region that had the maximum percentage of households with that burden (Los Angeles, at 24.5%) and the minimum percentage (Trinity at 10.6%) followed suit. Again, it was observed the mean and median (19.5% and 20.0%) overall skews towards these higher percentages.
# 
# For Question 2, we examine the same indicator metrics as Question 1, but instead narrow our scope to just the Bay Area Region and do so with a breakdown at the county-level. Today, the Bay Area is widely known to have some of (if not the) highest housing costs in the entire nation. Currently, residing in the Bay Area myself and having to deal with these high costs, I was curious to see what the housing cost burden looked like and how it varied county by county back between the years of 2006 and 2010. These high housing costs and therefore cost of living, was driven by the influx of well paid tech workers employed to the many large Bay Area tech companies (such Apple, Google, Facebook, etc). The sheer amount of high salary workers looking for homes in the Bay Area overwhelemed the available housing, thus causing a shortage and driving up the prices. Looking at our dataframe, a maximum of 45% of households in Solano County were burdened by a housing costs that were at least 30% of the household's monthly income while the minimum percentage of households burdened by this was in San Francisco with only 39.4%. This distribution and variation doesn't appear to be too drastic across the different counties of the Bay Area region and overall they are relatively close ( ~3% difference) to the mean and median values calculated for all California counties . This parallels the >50% monthly income burden case but with Marin county at the top with 21.5% and Santa Clara county at the bottom with 18.4%. These max and min values fit the corresponding median and mean values calculated in the previous section (20.2%). Therefore, overall, between the years of 2006-2010, there does not appear to be a large disparity in burdened household percentages between counties in the Bay Area region with state counties as a whole.

# #### Housing Cost Burdens by Racial/Ethnic Group (State-wide)
# 
# The focus of question 3 was to assess how the percentage of burdened households varied by different ethnic/racial groups. In this part, we again take into consideration the entire state of California as a whole regardless of income levels and further breakdown the assessment by splitting it into (oth owner-occupied and renter-occupied households. Our data shows that, with respect to owner-occupied households, Latinos were at the top of both indicators showing household percetanges whose monthly incomes were consumed by at least 30% and 50% by housing costs (51.8% and 21.2%, respectively). On the otherhand, the White demographic comprised of the lowest percentage of households least burdened by at least 30% and 50% of their monthly income going toward housing costs (36% and 15.1%, respectively).  With respect to renter-occupied households, a similar disparity exists but for other race/ethnic groups. At 57.9% of African American households spending at least 30% of their monthly income on rent and 32.7% spending at least 50% on rent, the African American demographic is the group that is most burdened by housing costs concerning renter-occupied tenure. Asian households represented the smallest percentage were at least 30% of the monthly income was spent on rent, while only 21.6% of NHOPI households represented the smallest percentage spending at least 50% of income on rent. Compared to the difference between the highest and lowest percentages broken down at a region to region level, the disparity when comparing the highest and lowest percentages of households burdened by the same indicator is significantly larger when we examine the data based on race/ethnic group. This tells us that there is greater housing cost burden inequality at a racial/ethnic demographic level then there is at a geographic level. This is further supported by the large difference when comparing the mean/median values at an overall state-wide level vs. the maximum and minimum values shown at the race/ethnic group level. For instance, where 51.8% of Latino households were spending their 30% of monthly income on housing costs, the corresponding mean and median value (State-wide) were 43.1% and 42.5%, respectively, which is a significant difference.

# #### Housing Cost Burdens by Tenure (Mortgage & Rent) - California Census Tracts Statewide
# 
# The last two guiding questions in our exploratory analysis address the differences in housing cost burdens Californian households faced solely based on a mortage vs. rent perspective. First, by answering question 4, we delineate difference in tenure at a statewide level by Census Tract (CT). Our results show that of the top 5 burdened (>50% monthly income spent on housing cost) mortgage-paying households, 4 of the census tracts were within Los Angeles county and varied between 56% - 60%. Alarmingly, this is nearly three times the mean/median percentages of households which was calculated to 23.4% and 22.5%. On the otherhand, with respect to this counterpart of rent-paying households, 3 of the top 5 census tracts were in San Luis Obispo County as those results varied between 62% and 75%. Even for renter tenures only, the gap between the top results and the mean/median calculated value (approximately 25.5% for both) is considerably large. This characterizes how skewed the distribution of cost burdened households in California is when breaking our data down by CT. In other words, there are a much larger amount of CTs that show less households being burdened by high cost housing than there are of  CTs where high burden costs are more of a problem. This however, can be a misleading statistic as it does not weigh into account the sheer amount of households in each CT and population density (so long as the CT had greater than 50 households in our analysis). However, this indicator and metric is useful in telling us about the concentration of highly burdened households by geographic location.
# 
# Lastly, for my own personal interests, we narrow the boundaries and scope of our burden analysis by tenure type to just the Census Tracts within the Bay Area. Our results show how 4 different counties are represented in the top 5 Bay Area Census Tracts with the highest percentages of households with greater than 50% of their monthly income going to mortgage housing costs. In descending order and ranging from 57.2% to 54.5%, these counties are Santa Clara, Contra Costa, San Mateo and Alameda. The calculated mean and median burden percentages for the Bay Area Census tracts are 20.2% and 19.5%, which closely mirrors the disparity we observed with our results at the state-wide level. The higher quantity of census tracts where there is a small percentage or even 0% of burdened households compared to the smaller number census tracts with high percentage (but also significantly more households) skew our results. Compared to mortgage cost burdens, the rental cost burdens appears to be more common among Bay Area census tracts, with the top 5 results ranging from 60.5%  down to 57.2%. Santa Clara, Alameda and Sonoma county represent these top 5 census tracts. For comparison, the mean and median values are 20.5% and 20% respectively. Mortgage and rent cost burdens are an important distinction to analyze seperately since there can be differences in the housing needs (long vs. short term, # of individuals within your household) as well as time-based living situation (whether one has lived in the area for a long time as a homeowner or recently moved there for a new job) that can affect the likelihood and the degree/severity of the cost burden.

# ### Conclusion
# The observed insights from the results of our analysis and as illustrated by our data visualizations of the various indicators for Californian Household cost burdents between the years of 2006 and 2010 are summarized as follows:
# * Between 2006 and 2010, there is not a drastic difference between the maximum and minimum percentage of burdened households for Bay Area counties compared to the rest of the counties of the state as a whole. However, the overall mean/median burden percentages were skewed toward the higher end as opposed to being close to the midpoint between min/max. This indicates that most counties (especially those in the Bay Area) are "clustered" with having higher burdened household percentages.  
# 
# * There is an indisputable disparity in the proportionality between unburdened vs. burdened households by racial/ethnic group. The proportionality between Latino and African American households experiencing housing cost burdens compared to their corresponding unburdened households of the same demographic are far higher than White households. 1 in 4 White households are burdened by housing costs while approximately 1 in 2 Latino Households and  2 in 3 African American are burdened.
# 
# * From a statewide perspective, there is a correlation between having more mortage-based housing cost burdens than rent-based housing cost burdens with a higher total number of households in census tracts. A lower total number of households in a census tract correlates to a lower frequency of mortage-based cost burdens relative to rent-based ones. The trend holds true when limiting the scope to just households in census tracts of a specific region (e.g. Bay Area). This suggests where housing is more abundant, mortgage owners are more burdened than renters.

# 
# ### Future Work
# * Obtain more recent or current data and evaluate trends since the analyzed 2006-2010 time frame.
# 
# * Correlate data with mean/median income to see if salaries are being properly adjusted to fit cost of living, high  housing costs in specific areas known to have highly burdened households percentages
